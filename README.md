# Rock Paper Scissors Javascript Game

This is a small project which is part of the web development [Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) course within [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. This project aims to develop JS skills in general from debugging to integrating it with a UI via the creation of a Rock Paper Scissors Game.

It was built using HTML, CSS and JS.
